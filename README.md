Testing-Purposes-Only
=====================

This thing-a-ma-bob is for testing of github only as I am a newbie at this thing.

<header>Objectives / Goals:</header>
<p>Understanding how to use the interface of GitHub</p>
<p>Understanding the purpose and structure of repositories</p>
<p>Understanding the mechanics of forking</p>
<p>Not dying</p>

For starters, I would like to know how to fix the above problem of having all text be in one paragraph.
