=====================

This thing-a-ma-bob is for testing of github only as I am a newbie at this thing.

Objectives / Goals:

1) Understanding how to use the interface of GitHub<p>

2) Understanding the purpose and structure of repositories

3) Understanding the mechanics of forking

4) Not dying

For starters, I would like to know how to fix the above problem of having all text be in one paragraph.
