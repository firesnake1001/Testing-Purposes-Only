Testing-Purposes-Only
=====================

This thing-a-ma-bob is for testing of github only as I am a newbie at this thing.

<header>Objectives / Goals:</header>
<nl>
<1> Understanding how to use the interface of GitHub</1>
<2> Understanding the purpose and structure of repositories</2>
<3> Understanding the mechanics of forking</3>
<4> Not dying</4>

For starters, I would like to know how to fix the above problem of having all text be in one paragraph.
